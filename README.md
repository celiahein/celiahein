## 👋 Hello there!

I’m @celiahein. I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto. 🐝 I'm interested in separating pattern from process to identify community assembly drivers for over 100 bee species. 🐝

- 🌱 I’m currently devloping a program that identifies the optimal spatial scale of response for ecological community data using GLMMs and HPC. 
-  🖥️  I'm learning and practicing a vareity of skills including: statistical modelling, machine learning, and high performance computing.

- 🔎 I’m looking for help transistioning out of my PhD and identifying career opportunities beyond academia in computational and quantitative biology or data science. 
- 👀 I'm looking forward to expanding into predictive, spatially-explicit modelling and deep-learning neural networks. 
- 🙂 Please feel free to reach out!
