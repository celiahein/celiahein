## 👋 Hello there!

I’m @celiahein. I'm an ecological data scientist, recent PhD graduate, current postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto. 🐝 I'm investigating the influence of spatial scale on species distribution modelling 🐝

- 🌱 I recently developed a program that compares glmms to optimize the spatial scale for data collection of multiple bee species
-  🖥️  I use statistical modelling, machine learning, and high performance computing to solve complex problems, mainly in biological systems.

- 🔎 I’m seeking career opportunities beyond academia in computational and quantitative biology and data science. 
- 👀 I'm looking forward to expanding into predictive modelling and deep-learning.
- 🙂 Please feel free to reach out!



I would like to introduce my incredible collaborator: Edgar the Wise
